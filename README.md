# Green-Architecture-Formula

**EDUflow's Green Architecture Formula** is a practical decision-making system designed to make the calculations involved in designing a sustainable house more **efficient**, **transparent**, and **accessible** to everyone—from students and educators to aspiring architects and urban planners.

## 🌱 About the Project

Sustainability shouldn't be a guessing game.

This tool was developed by the **EDUFlow** group to simplify the process of selecting eco-conscious options—such as plants, materials, and energy systems—when designing buildings. By combining intuitive UI elements with science-backed data (like CO₂ absorption rates, cost-efficiency ratings, and space usage), it empowers users to visualize the **environmental impact** of their choices in real time.

## 🔧 Features

- 📊 **Real-Time Calculations** for CO₂ offset based on plant selections  
- 🪴 Curated database of **climate-appropriate plants and trees**  
- 🏠 Modular structure to support future expansions (materials, insulation, water systems)  
- 💸 Metrics include **cost efficiency**, **space requirements**, and **environmental benefit**  
- 🎓 Designed with education in mind — perfect for project-based learning
